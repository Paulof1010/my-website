        <h2>Teen Years</h2>
        <p>During my teenage years I've been active in sports, was always around my friends and played video-games.</p>
        <p>From 7th to 9th grade I took a two year course in Electromechanics. Afterwards I went to Science & Tech for my high-school diploma.</p>

      <div class="about-section" id="developer">
        <h2>Developer</h2>
        <p>I've always been curious about tech, so I've started a Web Development course at MasterD while I was still working my 'culture job'.</p>
        <p>The course was important cause I've developed a passion about Software Engineering.</p>
        <p>That passion took me to a search for more education as a Software Engineer, so I ended up signing up for Code For All's bootcamp.</p>
        <p>I was able to get a scholarship, which covered the entire cost of the bootcamp and allowed me to develop my skills as a Software Engineer.</p>
        <p>Shout out to <a href="https://www.santanderopenacademy.com">Santander Open Academy</a> & <a href="http://www.codeforall.com">Code for All_</a> for the opportunity!</p>
